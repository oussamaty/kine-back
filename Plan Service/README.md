# Calculating the daily caloric intake

Calculating the daily caloric intake needed to achieve a targeted weight in a specified time frame involves multiple steps. Here is a comprehensive guide to explain how we calculate your daily caloric intake:

### Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic physiological functions at rest. The calculation varies based on gender. Here are the used formulas:

- **Mifflin-St Jeor Formula**:
  - **For men**: `10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(years) + 5`
  - **For women**: `10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(years) - 161`

### Step 2: Determine Activity Level
Next, we need to adjust the BMR to account for physical activity. This is called the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

- **Sedentary**: `BMR * 1.2`
- **Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)**: `BMR * 1.375`
- **Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)**: `BMR * 1.55`
- **Very active (intense exercise/sports 6-7 days/week)**: `BMR * 1.725`
- **Extra active (very intense exercise/physical job & intense training 2x/day)**: `BMR * 1.9`

### Step 3: Determine Caloric Deficit/Surplus for Weight Change
To calculate the daily caloric intake required to reach your target weight in a specific time frame, we determine the total weight change desired and the rate at which you aim to achieve it.

- **Weight change**: `current weight - target weight`
- **Time frame**: in weeks

One kilogram of body weight is roughly equivalent to 7,700 calories. So, we can calculate the caloric deficit or surplus needed to achieve the desired change in weight:

- **Daily calorie change**: `(weight change in kg * 7700) / (timeHorizon in days)`

To achieve a caloric deficit for weight loss or caloric surplus for weight gain, we add or subtract the daily calorie change from the TDEE:

- **Daily caloric intake**: `TDEE - daily calorie change` for weight loss, `TDEE + daily calorie change` for weight gain.

### Step 4: Applying the Calculations
Based on the above steps, we apply the formulas and derive your recommended daily caloric intake.

Here's a quick example for clarity:

- **Gender**: Female
- **Birthdate**: April 1990 (33 years old)
- **Height**: 165 cm
- **Weight**: 70 kg
- **Targeted weight**: 60 kg
- **Time horizon**: 12 weeks

1. **Calculate BMR**:
  - `10 * 70 + 6.25 * 165 - 5 * 33 - 161 = 1411.25`

2. **Determine TDEE (assuming moderately active)**:
  - `1411.25 * 1.55 = 2187.44`

3. **Calculate daily calorie change**:
  - `(70 - 60) * 7700 / (12 * 7) = 916.67`

4. **Calculate daily caloric intake**:
  - `2187.44 - 916.67 ≈ 1270.77` (approx. 1271 calories/day)

This is a basic calculation method.

# Determining whether a targeted weight is realistic
Here's how we assess whether your targeted weight is realistic:

### Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a general measure used to assess whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on your height and weight. It doesn't take muscle mass or other factors into account, but it's a starting point.

- **Formula**:
`BMI = weight (kg) / height (m²)`
- **BMI Categories**:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: BMI 18.5–24.9
  - Overweight: BMI 25–29.9
  - Obese: BMI ≥ 30

We calculate your current BMI and compare it with the BMI at your targeted weight to understand where you fall within these categories. A realistic target typically falls within the "normal weight" range, but we take individual variation into consideration.

# Determining whether a timeframe is realistic

To determine whether a given time frame for weight loss or weight gain is realistic, we consider several factors, including safety, sustainability, and individual variability. Rapid weight loss or gain can be harmful and is often unsustainable. Here is how we assess whether the time frame is realistic:

### General Recommendations for Weight Loss/Gain
- **Weight Loss**: A generally accepted and safe rate for weight loss is 0.5 to 1 kg (1 to 2 pounds) per week. Rapid weight loss can lead to muscle loss, nutritional deficiencies, and other health risks.
- **Weight Gain**: For healthy weight gain, a rate of 0.25 to 0.5 kg (0.5 to 1 pound) per week is typically recommended, emphasizing muscle gain rather than just body fat.

### Calculate the Expected Rate of Change
Based on your desired weight change and time frame, we calculate the rate of change (in kg per week):

- **Expected rate of change (kg/week)**:
  `(current weight - target weight) / timeHorizon (weeks)`

### Compare with General Recommendations
- If the expected rate of change is within the recommended range (0.5 to 1 kg per week for weight loss; 0.25 to 0.5 kg per week for weight gain), then your time frame is likely realistic.
- If the expected rate of change is outside these ranges, your time frame may not be realistic or safe, and you should consider extending it.

### Considerations for Safety and Sustainability
- **Health Risks**: Rapid weight loss/gain can lead to adverse health effects, including loss of muscle mass, nutritional deficiencies, gallstones, or eating disorders.
- **Sustainability**: Drastic changes in calorie intake or extreme dietary restrictions are typically not sustainable in the long term, often leading to yo-yo dieting.
- **Individual Variability**: Age, gender, metabolism, muscle mass, physical activity, and other factors influence weight loss/gain rates. A caloric deficit/surplus that works for one person might not be suitable for another.
